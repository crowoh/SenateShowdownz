# SenateTakedownz
A Website that displays all of the names and organizations that have funded our congressmen in relation to each other, and other general information for each representative.


I believe that public information should be viewed information. I wanted to create a website directory that shows an accurate visual representation of the names and organizations that have funded our congressmen for lobbyism purposes. 
Purely for educational and recreational purposes.

Creates an easily accessible visual breakdown of all contributors tied to each senator, along with graphs and personal links to their contact info.
