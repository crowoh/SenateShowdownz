Overview
SenateShowdownz is an insightful and interactive web platform designed to illuminate the financial landscape behind congressional campaigns. My goal is to bring transparency to the forefront of political discourse by providing an accessible, visual breakdown of the contributors, organizations, and entities funding United States senators.

Purpose
This was originally a project to help me learn and understand XML parsing. SenateShowdownz is born out of the belief that public information should not only be available but also easily comprehensible.

Features
Comprehensive Contributor Visuals: Interactive and detailed visual representations of the names and organizations funding each senator.
Comparative Analysis: Tools to compare financial backing among senators, offering insights into potential influences and lobbying trends, and choosing each individual state.
Senator Profiles: Individual profiles for each senator, including graphs and personal information, along with direct links to their contact information and official web pages.
Educational Resource: An invaluable tool for educators, journalists, researchers, and politically engaged citizens seeking to understand the financial forces shaping congressional legislation.
Usage
SenateShowdownz is designed with accessibility in mind. Simply select a state from the directory to view a comprehensive breakdown of their funding sources. Our intuitive interface allows for easy navigation and comparison between different senators' financial backers.
